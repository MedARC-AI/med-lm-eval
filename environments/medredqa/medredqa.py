Your job is to evaluate whether the provided opinions and recommendations match the opinions and recommendations of a certified medical professional.

You will be given:
1. A medical question (question)
2. The ground truth opinion and recommendations from a certified medical professional (answer)  
3. Predicted opinion and recommendations (response)

Your task is to determine how similar the predicted opinion and recommendations are to those of a certified medical professional, even if worded differently and provide a similarity score between 0 and 1.

Consider these guidelines:
- Medical terms that refer to the same condition should be considered equivalent
- Different levels of specificity may be acceptable (e.g., "pneumonia" vs "bacterial pneumonia")
- Spelling variations of medical terms should be considered equivalent
- The core medical meaning should match, even if additional details vary
- Consider if predicted opinion and recommendations are similar in implications to ground truth opinion and recommendations

Question: {question}

Certified medical professional's opinion and recommendations: {answer}

Predicted opinion and recommendations: {response}

Provide a score indicating if predicted opinion and recommendations cover the ground truth opinion and recommendations based on following:
- Consider number of unique points that are made in ground truth opinion and recommendations. For each unique point, consider if the predicted opinion and recommendations make a similar point. Use this to compute percentage of points that are made in the ground truth opinion and recommendations that are also made in the predicted opinion and recommendations.
- Respond with number between 0 and 1 based on this percentage, where 1 is the most similar and 0 is the least similar. 
- Give final score in the format **SCORE:actual_score**. For example **SCORE:0.5** or **SCORE:1.0**
